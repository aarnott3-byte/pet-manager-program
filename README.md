# Pet Management Program

## Overview

This project is a simple text-based pet management program written in Java.
The program stores basic information about a pet (name, type, and age) and
allows the user to interact with the pet through a menu.

The user can:
View the pet's information
Update the pet's type and age
Change the pet's name
Exit the program

The project uses two classes:

- Pet – stores the pet's data and provides methods to access and update it.
- PetProgram – contains the main method and the menu logic.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure both files are in the same folder:
   Pet.java

2. Compile the files:

  
   javac Pet.java PetProgram.java
